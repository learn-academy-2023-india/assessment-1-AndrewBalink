// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.
// There is no need to change any of the code.

// // --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
// const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// // console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// // a) Your answer:
// // b) Verify and explain:

// // --------------------1) What will this log?

// const cohort = "LEARN 2023"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// // a) Your answer: This will log the number 10 because it is counting the entire characters within the string.
// // b) Verify and explain: It does in fact log the number 10 because it is counting the entire characrers of the index by returning a length property of the string. 

// // --------------------2) What will this log?

// const greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[4])

// // // a) Your answer: This will log the letter "o" as it is referencing a single character.
// // // b) Verify and explain: This does in fact log the letter "o" as it is referencing a single character from the string by its index. 

// // --------------------3) What will this log?

// const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
// const index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// // a) Your answer: This will log "Ruby" because it is at the index of 1.  
// // b) Verify and explain: This does in fact log "Ruby" because "Ruby" is the value and is located at the index of 1. 

// // --------------------4) What will this log?

// const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// // a) Your answer: This will log the change of "saturday" and "sunday" from lowercase to uppercase letters. 
// // b) Verify and explain: This logged "TypeError: weekendDays.toUpperCase because this is not a function. The "toUpperCase" method is not a method of arrays. It is strings. 

// // --------------------5) What will this log?

// const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean", "undefined"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// // a) Your answer: I am not sure. I suspect it will log the number 4, as there are four items in the array.
// // b) Verify and explain: The "length" property of an array returns the number of elements in the array, and the "typeof" operator is used to get the data type of its operand. "typeof dataTypes.length" returns "number" because the "length" property of an array is a number data type.
